                <p>1. The game is played with a standard 52-card deck.</p>
                <p>2. Each player is dealt 7 cards (5 cards if there are 4 or more players).</p>
                <p>3. The remaining cards are placed face down to form a draw pile.</p>
                <p>4. Players take turns asking a specific player for a specific rank of card.</p>
                <p>5. If the player asked has the card, they must give all cards of that rank to the asking player.</p>
                <p>6. If the player asked does not have the card, they say "Go Fish" and the asking player draws a card from the draw pile.</p>
                <p>7. If a player collects all four cards of the same rank, they place them face up in front of them.</p>
                <p>8. The game continues until all sets of four are collected.</p>
                <p>9. The player with the most sets of four wins the game.</p>
